          St. Robert's International College (SRIC) was established in May 2004 as a TESDA institution offering
          Caregiver course. The college was inaugurated in its first location in Magalona Building along Ledesma Street,
          Iloilo City in May 2004, and occupied the campus until 2006. While in Magalona Building, SRIC expanded to
          accommodate its growing number of students thus, rented the RBH Building along Lopez Jaena Street. Later in
          2006, the college moved to a much bigger location – the Casa Plaza Building in front of the Iloilo Capitol
          Building. While a TESDA Institution, SRIC produced the most number of NCII Passers, at 98% batting percentage
          probably the highest in the region.

          In 2010, SRIC established its Basic Education Department and transferred to the Cooper Building in front of
          Amigo Terrace Hotel in General Hughes Street, Iloilo City. In 2013, SRIC held its first graduation that
          produced its first batch of elementary and high school graduates.

          In 2013, again to accommodate its growing number of students, SRIC once again transferred to the famous GST
          Building along Quezon Street. It is in GST Building that SRIC reaped recognitions both locally and
          internationally.

          With the massive increase in enrolment, the SRIC Board was forced to look for a much bigger location that
          features a regular school facility. It was not very long before their prayers were granted. In December 2016,
          the members of the Board of SRIC signed the historic Lease Contract with the Vincentian Fathers with no less
          than the Father Provincial Rev. Fr. Venerando D. Agner CM, signing on behalf of the Vincentian Fathers in the
          Philippines. The Lease Contract granted a 15-year lease to SRIC with the option for renewal.

          The SY 2017-18 was ushered by the Mass of the Holy Spirit held in the Jaro Metropolitan Cathedral, just a
          stone’s throw from the De Paul Campus of St. Robert’s International College. The old De Paul Campus was
          quickly renovated to reflect the Robertine culture: repainting and refurbishing of the façade was immediately
          done; classrooms and offices were transformed into air-conditioned spaces; the Robertine Champion Hall was
          functionalized. When the new SRIC campus was inaugurated in June of 2017, the new Father Provincial in his
          homily stated his satisfaction over the physical improvement of their old De Paul Campus and admonished the
          President to include the Vincentian charism in the values formation of the Robertines. Dr. Robert Galindez in
          his part when he delivered his message declared that the new pedagogical principle of the college is to
          transform its Learners into Intellectual Giant, with Giant Hearts – the giant heart is St. Vincent’s role in
          the Robertine education. In June of 2018, the new Robertine Gym was inaugurated – a living testimony to
          Robertine’s supremacy in Basketball and other sporting events.

          Sixteen years after the foundation of SRIC as a TESDA school; and 10 years after the creation of the Basic
          Education Department, St. Robert’s International College continues its vision of “Leading the way towards
          Excellent, World-class, God-centered, and Learner oriented education”. SRIC is the youngest among the private
          schools in Iloilo City and probably in Western Visayas but St. Robert’s International College is already an
          ISO 9001:2015 certified, FAPE accredited, PEAC certified, and most especially, already a Franchise as
          developed by the country’s top franchise developer – FranCorp. SRIC also operates its Open High School and
          MISOSA in Laguna, and Bangkok, Thailand.
        </p>

          2022 is a great year for SRIC winning the Premier Standard Private School (Iloilo Awards) during the 9th Elite
          and Leadership Awards Night 2022. In November of the same year, SRIC has been granted membership to the
          Council of International School (CIS) which is probably the only one in Western Visayas.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the franchising opportunity offered by SRIC, Saints Robert and Vincent will help scatter the Robertine
          seed around the country and abroad.
